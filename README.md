# GPTrip

GPTrip is a travel planning web application that uses OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to generate personalized travel recommendations based on user preferences. Built using React, Node.js, and Express, GPTrip asks users a series of questions about their travel preferences, including destination, dates, and activities they're interested in. This information is then passed to the OpenAI API, which generates a recommendation based on the user's responses.

The application also uses the Unsplash API to search for relevant images of the recommended destination and dynamically generates a travel page with information about the recommended location, including website links, coordinates, hotel recommendations, and activities to do. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

GPTrip is deployed using Vercel for the front end and Render for the server side. By utilizing AI and APIs, GPTrip provides users with a unique and personalized travel planning experience that can help them discover new and exciting destinations.
